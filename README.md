# Wine Color and Quality Analysis – MATH 237 Project 2

### Overview
This project investigates the main chemical and pysical properties that influence wine color and wine quality. Specifically, it examines how measurable chemical properties such as acidity, sugar content, sulfur compounds, density, and alcohol levels relate to whether a wine is classified as red or white, and how these same features influence wine quality ratings. Understanding these relationships is useful for wine producers, quality control specialists, and consumers interested in how measurable properties influence wine characteristics

The analysis is split into two parts:

Part 1: Predicting Wine Color (Red vs. White)

Part 2: Predicting Wine Quality

### Dataset Description
The Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository includes two related datasets describing physicochemical properties and quality scores for red and white Vinho Verde wines from Portugal. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a wine sample characterized by 11 real-valued chemical measurements and one sensory quality score.

### Objectives
1. What features are the strongest determinate of wine color?
2. Does alcohol, sugar, and density have an effect on the color of wine?
3. Does color have an effect on the quality of the wine?
4. What features best determine what the quality of the wine is?
